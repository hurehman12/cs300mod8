# cs300mod8
portfolio submission for week 8

In these projects, I was focused on learning how to store, organize, and work with data more efficiently using different data structures. Project One was about analyzing the run-time and memory usage of vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees. Project Two involved building a program that could load course data, sort courses in alphanumeric order, and display course information based on user input. Overall, the goal was to understand how choosing the right data structure affects how well a program performs.

I approached each project by first understanding what the program needed to do and then deciding which data structure made the most sense for the task. Data structures are important because they directly impact performance, especially as the amount of data grows. Comparing different structures helped me see the trade-offs between speed, memory usage, and complexity, and showed me that there is no one-size-fits-all solution.


One challenge I ran into was getting the data to load correctly and making sure the sorting and searching logic worked consistently. When things did not work as expected, I broke the problem down into smaller pieces and tested each part separately. Using debugging and revisiting Big-O concepts helped me figure out where issues were coming from and fix them.

These projects helped me slow down and think more about design before writing code. Instead of immediately coding, I now focus more on understanding the problem and thinking through how different design choices affect performance and flexibility. This has made my overall approach to software design more organized and intentional.

Working on these projects helped me write cleaner and more readable code by separating logic into functions and using clearer naming. Designing the program so different data structures could be used with minimal changes showed me the value of writing adaptable code. These habits make programs easier to maintain and update in the future.
